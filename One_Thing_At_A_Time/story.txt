					SETTING
					03/07/2018
========================================================

In a dusty, arid, polluted fertile desert valley,
surrounded by mountains, a city has risen up. Not a major

metropolis, like the one south of the mountains. Rather,
this city is characterized by its farms, its oil wells,
and the other occupations - grocers, doctors, etc.
required to support the city's main industries.

					INTRODUCTION
					03/17/2018
========================================================

	The world is in chaos. International wars have wiped
out the majority of the population. City states have
risen from the ashes of society and most are led by
cruel tyrants. One in particular prides itself on it's
mass amounts of oil they frack from the earth. Weapons
of any sort are outlawed unless you serve the local
regime. Firearms are almost nonexistent as the rulers of
most city states destroyed them to prevent uprisings.
Their footsoldiers are primarily armed with crude looking
axes, swords and clubs made from scraps of worn down
buildings. The Elite Guard is armed with weapons from the
Old World from Tyler's personal cache. Slavery is rampant,
especially in the oil fields. Moisture farms designed to
process water particulates in the air are the most precious
resource in the world. There is a threat of war looming
on the horizon. It is said that one of the city-states has
developed a weapon capable of wiping out all life in an
area without harming structures or other resources.
