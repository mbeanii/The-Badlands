Marcus:
"... from Tyler's personal cache." Who is Tyler?
Code is limping steadily along.
It'll now take "w", "a", "d", or "s" commands and move you,
then print your location, a description of it, your "status"
(right now it just says "dirty"), and your inventory.

I'd really like to draw a map, but I could use more story
first so I can include places in the story. Unless you'd
like to tailor your story to my map?

Frank:
Come up with a base map if you'd like and I can roll with it.
I'll make descriptions of whatever places you stick on there

Marcus:
Who's Tyler?

Frank:
Filler name. I was thinking of turning him into a Solo-esque
smuggler or arms dealer. Could be a her.
He or she will probably be a douche baggy anti hero only out
for themselves. Like Del Toro in the last Farce Wars movie.

Marcus:
Gotcha. Anti-hero, so he's a good guy? The "Elite Guard" too?
Do they work for him?
I'm kind of obsessing over this project at the moment.

Frank:
Good is used loosely. Elite Guard is definitely bad. But
likely one of them will be a traitor (on the main characters
side.) Tyler or whatever the name winds up being is double
agent-y

Marcus:
Gotcha, so Tyler is supplying weapons to the bad guys? Is the
elite guard a body of soldiers?

Frank:
Yeah. I was thinking along the lines of Roman Praetorians or
the Imperial Guard.
Hybridized with the SS

Marcus:
Gotcha - I love it. So like, MUCH tougher than your average
combat encounter.

Frank:
Yes. I would use them for mini bosses. Their commander could
be a boss.
Call him Damien.

Marcus:
Mini-bosses, cool. I was kinda thinking along those lines.
Damien is "a" boss. Is he the final boss, or are there people
worse than him?

Mutants - They are systematically hunted. There's a mutant
city.

There are several different "races" of mutants to choose
between. Each has slightly different powers. Possibly
slightly different back stories as well. The PC will be a
mutant.

Brute - strength based abilities.

Seer or something - psyonic abilities.

[Something] - Manipulates light. Force fields, magnification,
etc.
