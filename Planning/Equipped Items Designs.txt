    - Options for printing inventory? How to print equipped items - Little ASCII
diagram of a guy with arrows pointing to places:
                              _
Helmet                       ( )         
                             _|___   Right Arm                 | <-- 28th character
Left Arm                    |---        
                             ---     Armor
Feet                        _| |_     

This approach would mean a 28 character maximum for object names.
Greater Sword of Apprehension (Keen) (37 characters) - Much too long.
Or we'd have to have some smarts in there so it wrapped to the next line, which would
buy us 28 more characters for a total of 56, but it would make it harder to read.
It'll already require a little bit of smarts to correctly format strings of varying
lengths.
A word wrap might be possible so it pans the string within the alloted space, but
this might be tricky to implement.
Abbreviations might help
Gtr Swd of Apprehension (Kn) (28 characters) - Though for readablity, this might
not be the best either.
What about something like:

 ______________________
/ ____________________  \
| /                    \ |
| |          _         | |
| |  ____   ( )        | |
| | /       _|_        | |
| | |   _  |---|    ___| |
| | |  /    ---     _____|
| | |  |   _| |_
| | |  |
| | |  |   |
| | |  |   \_ Feet     :
| | |  \_____ Left Arm :
| | \________ Head     :
| \__________ Right Arm:
\____________ Chest    :

This would be way less formatting heavy because the strings won't throw off the
ASCII art.

But what about something simple like:

  _    Head      :
 ( )   Neck      :
 _|_   Left Arm  :
|---|  Right Arm :
 ---   Chest     :
_| |_  Feet      :
       Left Ring :
       Right Ring:

I like the last one the best, though the rings are a little clunky...
