From "Master Plan.txt":
Make the master object list a global const variable inside Object.h and Object.c:
const std::vector<Object> masterObjectList
0001

So, I actually think I'm okay with it as it is - moving it to global scope would
actually be a step back as far as object-oriented implementation is concerned. A
couple of changes are appropriate however:

X Create a nondefault constructor for Objects so we can use Object(blah,blah,blah) to
create Objects
X Update createObjects to use the nondefault constructor.
When testing this, I'm having Visual Studio compile errors. A lot of them and all
kind of weird.

Looks like it's an installation issue with Visual Studio.
I installed the recommended package. Then I clicked update on Visual Studio Community
2017. It's kind of a big download (1.53 GB).
This failed to resolve the issue. Troubleshooting solutions.
There's an "if the problem still persists..." instruction. Following that. That fixed
it. It seemed to be a compatibility issue going between Windows 10 on my home computer
and Windows 7 on my work computer.
    ? Can I do this in one line?
        ? Is it possible to have a vector of distinct variables all with the same name?
Or with no name at all. From Asteroids, try masterObjectsList.pushback(new Object(blah, blah, blah));
X Create a member function within the Game class which will push a new Object to his
masterObjectList with given properties.
I was able to implement and test this.

I was able to implement and test this - merging to master.

Where is the master object list now? What changes will be required?
It's a private member of the Game class (below).

- A nondefault constructor for Objects will need to be created so we can use
Object(blah,blah,blah); notation to create an object.

- createObjects will need to be changed - probably moved to the Object class as well.

class Game
{
private:
	std::vector<Object> masterObjectList;
	std::vector<Object *> startingEquipment;
	PC pc;
	StartArea startArea;
	Area * pCurrentArea;
	Location *pCurrentLocation;
	std::string move = "";

	void createObjects();
	void printFullDescription();
	void executeMove();
	void executeMoveGet(std::string objectName);
	void uiGetMove();
	void parseMove();
	void printIntro();
	void pickUpObject(std::string objectName);
	Object *lookupObjectFromName(std::string objectName);

public:
	Game();
};
