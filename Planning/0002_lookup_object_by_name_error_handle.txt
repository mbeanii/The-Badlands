- Error handle lookupObjectByName. If an object isn't found in the list, an assert should be
triggered:
 else
{
assert(false);
},
Or an exception should be thrown.

Changed function name to "lookupObjectByName" from "lookupObjectFromName"
Next step would be to test this.
I also neglected to make a seperate git branch for this. That should be resolved.
The change should have a git branch.
