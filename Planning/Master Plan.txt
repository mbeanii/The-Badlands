==================================================================================================

Object:
- Make the master object list a private static const member variable of the Object class:
static const std::vector<Object> masterObjectList inside Object.h and Object.c.
0001

Game:
- Move starting equipment to the PC's default constructor.
- Change "move" to "command" (std::string move, getMove, parseMove, executeMove, etc.)
- Verify the getCommand, parseCommand, and executeCommand workflow

Commands:
- Implement "examine" or "x" command to return the description of an object either in your
inventory or in the current location
- Implement "north", "south", "east", and "west" full name commands as alternatives to the
"n", "s", "e", "w" commands
- Permissions, error handling, documentation

Character:
- Equiping items
- Attributes, skills, powers, abilities, experience points, etc.
- Combat
- Team
    - Play as one main character, but with a party (like Baldur's Gate I/II)
    - Adding/removing NPC team members

Area/Location:
- Verify the Area/Location workflow - where and how are the different areas stored?
The different locations? Somehow each area should contain its locations, each location
should contain its buildings, and each building should contain its rooms. We also want
a scaleable architecture so we can implement maybe countries having multiple areas,
continents with multiple countries, worlds with multiple continents, galaxies with multiple
worlds, universes with multiple galaxies, etc. We should also be able to scale the other
direction in case we need subrooms - maybe if you're shrunk, then you'd maybe want a whole 
big space that is the "table," say, as one use case. Of course the use case for the galaxies/
universes capability would be a sci-fi world where interdimensional travel is a reality.
- Traveling between Areas (and beyond) - it'd probably be a specific location you'd have to
visit, just like within a building, you could only travel between rooms with doors between
them.
- Fast Travel - probably from the map
- Building/Room (subsets and subsubsets of locations)
- Map
    - Add locations you have visited to your area map
    - Buildings you have visited to your location map?
    - Rooms you have visited to your building map (ie, Legend of Zelda dungeons?)

Events?
- Combat
    - Trigger
    - Description
    - Effect:
e.g., you get burned, you lose a level, you activate a trap, you are seen by the monster, etc.
        - Maybe the effect from the event is added to an "effects to be processed on this
character this cycle" attribute list on each character, then each cycle the effect parser is
called to cycle through each "character here" and apply each effect.

Effect parser:
Should be usable by:
    - events
    - spells
    - items
        - one shot,
        - equippable items with a permanent effect on the user
        - equippable weapons with effects on a target
            - Weapons with special hit effects (e.g., posion arrows, flaming sword, etc.)
            - Items with a special use/property (e.g., ring of webs, etc.)
