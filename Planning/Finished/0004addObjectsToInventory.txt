X Write a function which takes a string with the name of a character and a vector of object strings, 
looks up the character and objects, and places them in the character's inventory.

Wrote this, but when debugging it, the inventory items are not making it to the pc inventory.

Looks like I've got two different PCs - one in the character list, and one in Game... I suspect I'll want
to get rid of the PC at the Game scope. This may solve it.

I need to fix the character virtual function inheritance to ensure the pc's correct function is getting called.

I fixed it by putting the PC back into the Game -- because it's a PC and not just a Character, it can't be
stored in a vector of Characters, rather it should be pointed to by a vector of character pointers. There
should be a vector of Characters as well that store the non-PC characters. This one is done.
