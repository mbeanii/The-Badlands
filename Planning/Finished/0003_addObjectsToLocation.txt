X Write a function in Game which takes a location and vector of object strings and a location string, looks 
up the objects, looks up the location and places the objects in the location.
- Utilize this function in the default game constructor. This may require structural edits to Area, which
is the first item under Area in the master plan txt file.
X Drastically change Areas - startArea shouldn't have its own class, it should be an instance of a
class, presumably created at the Game level.

12/22/2018 This one is done... It will be enhanced later with the lookup functionality, but for now, it just
needs to be pushed and merged.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following item from the Master Plan is being added to the scope of this story:
X Drastically change Areas - startArea shouldn't have its own class, it should be an instance of a
class, presumably created at the Game level.
X Looks like I'll need new files, "map.h" and "map.c" They will be at the Game Level, or eventually above it.
They will contain all the details of where the locations and areas will go. How will that information be
stored? Probably just an enum. The existing architecture should work... In which case, I won't need a .c
file, just a .h.
Map.h created.
X Create the following function:
	void Area::createLocation(std::string name, std::string description, int row, int col)
    X This will require changing pLocationMap to just "locationMap". This is going to get messy.
I did this. As expected, it had a number of ripple effects. The build still works, but my placed objects
are gone now. My inventory still works, though.
I stepped through the code where the objects are getting pushed, and it looks like that part of it is working
okay. I'll need to investigate further.
Looks like the issue is that currentLocation isn't getting set properly.
Well, the sword is back; Check location doesn't seem to be doing it's job. Also, I've created locations named
"." that let me travel to them. That'll need to be resolved. Also, I'll need to figure out why my cat isn't
making it to the mountain.

Okay -- I fixed the vector access unhandled exceptions by fixing up checkArea. I can now set the area location
map row col define to 2 and everyone is happy. However, the cat still isn't in the mountain, and if I don't
pick up the sword the first time I'm at the mountain, the sword vanishes. I suspect the cat is getting to
the mountain, but it's later getting erased. I'll track this down tomorrow.

So, the cat actually *is* in the mountain -- the game just isn't seeing it there.

Area::printObjectsHere may be broken.
Location::lookupObjectsHere too.

startArea has a member named mountain whose objectsHere contains a cat.

However, pCurrentLocation is set to mountain, but doesn't contain a cat. Where is that set?
Game::executeMove()

The confusion is that Game::executeMove() is using pCurrentArea, not startArea. It's probably about time to take
startArea out of the game (Hooray!) One problem is that hte locationMap only has 2 locations in it... the
moisture farm and the barren waste. I'm not sure how the mountain is showing up at all!

But also, the location Map is supposed to be a 2D array, so I should look at that more closely.

Yeah, okay nevermind. The locations are all in there. I think the fix is just to set the original location to
pCurrentArea-><location> instead of startArea-><location>, and also to push the objects back to pCurrentArea's
version instead of startArea's version. This is coming together well.

populateCountry needs to be unstubbed, as does // DEFINE LOCATIONS
lookupLocationHere might be broken (returning nullLocation)

The next step is probably to try to remove startArea entirely from the game and fix what needs fixing.

IT WORKS!

void placeObjects(std::vector<std::string> objectList, std::string locationName)
{
    try
    {
        find the location (may need a helper function - inside should throw an error if there's no location)

        for all of the objects
            add the object to the location (I think there's already a method for this - does it throw errors?)
    }
    catch(char *message)
    {
        cerr << message << endl;
    }
        
}

X Add a vector of Areas to Game.
country
X Push_back startArea onto the vector of Areas.
X Write masterLocationLookup using masterObjectLookup as a guide (it will have to search
each Area in the Area vector for the location - sounds like a nested for loop).

Problem - as it currently is, *pLocationMap is a 2D Array, not a vector, so nested iterators won't do...
It might be cleaner to to turn *pLocationMap into a vector at some point, but for now, we should use what is
there to access it as it is.

X Adding a lookupLocationHere function to Area.

X Write placeObject - another helper function
