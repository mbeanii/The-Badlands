- Error handle lookupObjectByName. If an object isn't found in the list, an assert should be
triggered:
 else
{
assert(false);
},
Or an exception should be thrown.

Interesting. I included the else assert(false) and my program threw an exception - I'll want to
debug this...

Found it - the assert shouldn't have been an else to the if; rather it should follow the loop.
Fixed. Tested. It works, so I'm moving this story to completed, pushing, and merging the story.

I just pushed the branch to master, then created a new branch for 0002 for the assert else statement,
which is the main change for this story.

Changed function name to "lookupObjectByName" from "lookupObjectFromName"
Next step would be to test this.
I also neglected to make a seperate git branch for this. That should be resolved.
The change should have a git branch.
