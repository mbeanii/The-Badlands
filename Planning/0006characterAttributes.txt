    hp
hp for a normal dude would be like 3 probably.
Maybe 1 for a child...
Would I ever need floats for computations or something? No. Not gonna do it.
A super boss might have a few hundred hit points. Like a dragon or something.
For the pc, a range of 8 (first level caster) to ~100 (nth level paladin)
