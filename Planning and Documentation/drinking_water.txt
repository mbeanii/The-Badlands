An

"Action"

Should include:

the string command

AND

the effect.

What does the effect look like?

Where will this be called?



ParseCommand gets a

"drink water" command.

It sees there are two words.

It identifies "water" as an object.

It looks up the object "water"

It finds the string "drink" in water's actionList, so it knows it's a valid command.

It executes

Every element in the actionList should have a corresponding "effect". How are these tied together?
A "use" member function? The function would have to be unique to each... maybe not.

What if the order of the actionList is what ties it to the effect.

How about an:

"actionList",
"affectedAttributeList"
"effectList" (e.g., "= 0", "+ 1", "= STATUS_QUENCHED", etc.)
"printStringList"

So picking up where I left off --

parseCommand calls executeCommand, passing it the water object and the "drink" string

executeCommand counts what number action "drink" is in water's actionList and saves this as num

executeCommand gets the numth affectedAttribute from the affectedAttributeList

executeCommand compares the affectedAttribute against a list of all possible attributes (each of the
member variables of the Character class)

executeCommand gets the numth effect from effectList

If the first character is "=", executeCommand sets the affectedAttribute to the given value.

If the first character is +, executeCommand increases the affectedAttribute by the given value.
