O How to do a "the next attack" as in "the next attack is triple damage" after an ability (Forestall)
X How do "normal" attacks work?
Included an enum for melee, ranged, special abilities, skills

- Classes
    Each class needs:
    - A favored stat, from which most of his abilities stem
    - signature weapons he performs better with (is this a proficiency thing? )
    - Class-specific Skills/Special Abilities
    - 
    
What about weapons proficiencies??
None - just bonuses for using certain weapons your class favors.

X Finish writing levelUp
I wrote this, but it should be moved to the application (game) level.
- Implement skills (write two skills at the top level)
- Implement special abilities (write two special abilities at the top level)
- Implement classes (write a class at the top level)
X Create getters and setters for each of those.
    X Finsh creating attack setters.
    - Create attack getters (hasNormalAttack, etc, returning a bool for each).
- Create a constructor with values for each of these
- Call the constructor from the Game default constructor
- Modify the print stats function to print them
- Implement "x self"
- Implement "x <character"
- Implement "x <object>"

Derived traits vs base traits.

Base traits:
st, dx, iq, ht

Derived traits:
hp (st) 
speed (ht)
meleeAcc (st/dx)
meleeDmg (st + <weapon>)
rangedAcc (dx)
rangedDmg (<weapon>)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What will be reasonable ranges for things?

    level
Start at level 1.
11 is the highest.
Leveling up:
- Add one to a base trait (total of 11 possible added)
- Learn/improve a skill? How do skills work? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Divide a number of points among derived traits as bonuses (This increases as they level up)

Derived Bonus Points | Level
LVL| BONUS
01 | 0
02 | 1
03 | 2
04 | 2
05 | 3
06 | 3
07 | 4
08 | 4
09 | 5
10 | 5
11 | 6

35 Total additional points

Base traits:
st, dx, iq, ht

    experience points
What about if you get a point per level of thing you kill? 1 pt for a Level 1, 2 for L2, etc.
Finishing a small side quest might be worth 3 xp
Finishing a main plot quest might be worht 10 xp

LVL|   EXP

    hp
hp for a normal dude would be like 3 probably.
Maybe 1 for a child...
Would I ever need floats for computations or something? No. Not gonna do it.
A super boss might have a few hundred hit points. Like a dragon or something.
For the pc, a range of 8 (first level caster) to ~100 (nth level paladin)
